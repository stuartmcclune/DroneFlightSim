# DroneFlightSim
Drone flight simulation (WIP)

A Unity and C# project to simulate the flight of a drone in order to develop a drone flight controller. As a challenge, I am not looking up how current solutions work. In the long term, I plan on using this simulation to assist with building and programming a physical drone that actively resists user input that would cause a collision.
